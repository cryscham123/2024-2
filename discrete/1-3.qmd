## Quantifiers

∀: p(x) is always true for all x in the domain
∃: p(x) is true for at least one x in the domain

¬∀p(x) is ∃¬p(x) and vice versa

### Uniqueness Quantifier
∃!x: p(x) is true for exactly one x in the domain

### precedence of Quantifiers
∀xp(x) v q(x) is equivalent to (∀xp(x)) v q(x)
