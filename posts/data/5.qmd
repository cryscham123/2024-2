## data normalization
- well formedness: each relational has only one theme
  every determinant must be a candidate key
### **normalization process**
한문제 내신단다.
1. identify all the candidate keys of relation
2. identify all functional dependencies in the relation
3. examine the determinants of the functional dependencies
  if the determinant is not a candidate key, not well-formed

is every determinant a candidate key? 
- if not, not well-formed

## functional dependency
- student_id -> student_name, student_major, student_grade
- course_id -> course_name, course_credit
- student_id, course_id -> score
- determinant -> dependent
- primary key of a relation will functionally determine all other attributes in the row
- **candidate key** can also functionally determine all other attributes in the row
