1. The foundations: logic and proofs
- Logic: Study of reasoning, including propositional and predicate logic.
- Proofs: Methods to demonstrate the truth of statements, including direct, indirect, and contradiction proofs.

3. Algorithms
- Design and Analysis: Techniques for creating efficient algorithms and analyzing their complexity.
- Sorting and Searching: Common algorithms like quicksort, mergesort, and binary search.

4. Number theory and cryptography
- Number Theory: Properties of integers, divisibility, prime numbers, and modular arithmetic.
- Cryptography: Techniques for secure communication, including encryption and decryption methods.

5. Induction and recursion
- Mathematical Induction: Proof technique used to prove statements about natural numbers.
- Recursion: Defining functions or sequences where the next term is derived from previous terms.

6. Counting
- Combinatorics: Study of counting, arrangement, and combination of objects.
- Permutations and Combinations: Methods to count arrangements and selections.

10. Graphs
- Graph Theory: Study of graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects.
- Applications: Network analysis, shortest path problems, and graph coloring.

## Proposition
declarative sentence that is either true or false
### propositional variable
p, q, r, s, ...
ex) p: it is raining
Negation: ㄱ false
Conjunction: ^ both is true => true, else false
Disjunction: v either is true => true, else false
Implication: -> if p then q
Biconditional: <-> p if and only if q

p->q is equivalent to ㄱp v q

### converse, contrapositive, inverse
1. converse: q->p
2. contrapositive: ㄱq -> ㄱp
3. inverse: ㄱp -> ㄱq

### Biconditional
p <-> q is equivalent to (p->q) ^ (q->p)
